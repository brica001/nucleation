# Fundamental inputs in "human readable (hr)" (intuitive units) for capsid assembly.da 
q_hr = 90 ### Number of subunits forming the capsid. Units: Dimensionless
Dg_hr = -12### Mean binding energy of a subunit in the full capsid. Units: kB*T0 where T0 is normal temperature (293.15 K).
T_hr = 25 ### Temperature of the system. Units: Celsius.
Rs_hr = 3 ## Subunit effective radius. Units: nm.
c0_hr = 100 ### Initial concentration of subunits. Units: nM (nano molar = nano mol/L)
Rh_hr=2.5 ### hydrodynamic radius estimate for folded globular protein (HBsAg,mw=24kDa)
Rc_hr=18 ###capsid radius (HBV) Units: nM
### Note: Rational for working in nM: 1 molecule in a bacteria (1 um^3 in volume) would be 1.66 nM (so ~1 nM is an insightful unit)

### Warning!!! Water viscosity given at T=25C. Module needed to include temperature dependence.
nu_hr = 0.890 ### Water viscosity. Units: cP (centiPoise).
